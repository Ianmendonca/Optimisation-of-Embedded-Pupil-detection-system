# Optimisation-of-Embedded-Pupil-detection-system
Here, an attempt is made to improve the processing time of the embedded system in detecting the pupil from a live feed data of the eye

This project inspired by the work done in ["An Embedded and Real-Time Pupil Detection Pipeline"](https://github.com/ankurrajw/Pi-Pupil-Detection.git)
